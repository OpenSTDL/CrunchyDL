## Getting Started on Windows
**Step 1:** Download the latest windows installer [here](https://github.com/stratuma/Crunchyroll-Downloader-v4.0/releases).

**Step 3:** Run the app.

## Login Proxies
Since v1.1.3 the downloader uses proxies to log in to crunchyroll, the reason for this is that a lot of content is now geoblocked.

The servers are secure and hosted by big hosters like hetzner and ovh, also no login data is logged.

To deactivate it you just have to go to settings -> proxy and uncheck login proxy.

## DRM Protected Streams
If Crunchyroll disables access to the last DRM free accesspoint I will post a guide on [Discord](https://discord.gg/grGkK4bH95) explaining the widevine stuff and how to bypass it with the downloader.
